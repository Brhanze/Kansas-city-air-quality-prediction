# Kansas City Air Quality Prediction 🌫️

This project uses time series modeling to predict seasonal air quality in Kansas City using historical AQI data. The model identifies pollution trends and anomalies to assist in public health and environmental planning.

## 📌 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- LSTM (Keras, TensorFlow)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- AWS SageMaker

## 📈 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values and resampling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Trend visualization and correlation heatmaps
3. **Modeling** – Trained an LSTM model on AQI time series data
4. **Evaluation** – Achieved ~92% accuracy with RMSE as a metric

## 📊 Results
- Plotted historical vs predicted AQI
- Detected seasonal patterns in PM2.5 levels
